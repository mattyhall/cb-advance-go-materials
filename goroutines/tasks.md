1. Write one goroutine that sums all the numbers from 1 to 10000 and one that sums all the numbers from 10000 to 20000. Use a WaitGroup to synchronise. Which goroutine finishes first? Does it always finish first? Why?

2. Increment your WaitGroup by one less. What happens?

3. Increment your WaitGroup by one more. What happens?
